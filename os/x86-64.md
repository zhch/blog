### 内存管理

#### 64-Bit Canonical Addresses
Long mode defines 64 bits of virtual address, but implementations of the AMD64 architecture may
  support fewer bits of virtual address. Although implementations might not use all 64 bits of the virtual
  address, they check bits 63 through the most-significant implemented bit to see if those bits are all
  zeros or all ones. An address that complies with this property is said to be in canonical address form. If
  a virtual-memory reference is not in canonical form, the implementation causes a general-protection
  exception or stack fault.

#### 内存寻址过程4个地址
* Logical Addresses：Logical Address = Segment Selector : Offset。也称作 far pointers. Far pointers are used in software addressing
  when the segment reference must be explicit
* Effective Addresses：Programs provide effective addresses to the hardware prior to segmentation and paging translations. Long-mode effective addresses are a maximum of 64 bits wide。
* Linear (Virtual) Addresses：Linear Address = Segment Base Address + Effective Address。When the flat-memory model is used—as in 64-bit mode—a segment-base address is treated as 0. In
  this case, the linear address is identical to the effective address. In long mode, linear addresses must be
  in canonical address form。
* Physical Addresses： A physical address is a reference into the physical-address space, typically
  main memory. Physical addresses are translated from virtual addresses using page-translation
  mechanisms.

#### Effective Address5种模式
1. Absolute Addresses: 作为当前数据段base的offset给出
2. Instruction-Relative Addresses: 作为当前IP的相对offset给出。出现在control-transfer 指令中，可以直接编码在指令中，或者从内存中读取。
3. Indexed Register-Indirect Addresses：如下图所示，base在指令指定的general-purpose寄存器中；index和displacement直接编码在指令中

4. Stack Addresses：PUSH, POP, CALL, RET, IRET, 和 INT 指令 隐式使用stack
  pointer
5. String Addresses：String instructions generate sequential addresses using the rDI and rSI registers

### 分页
Page translation uses a hierarchical data structure called a page-translation table to translate virtual
pages into physical-pages. The number of levels in the translation-table hierarchy can be as few as one
or as many as four, depending on the physical-page size and processor operating mode. 

支持4K、2M和1G三种Page Size，参见说明图示：[1GB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1244560/50535759-3ee28080-0b88-11e9-8a07-35f1c7d6d577.png) 、[2MB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1244560/50535755-3722dc00-0b88-11e9-9363-c3f4f2148d06.png)和[4KB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1244560/50535753-2ecaa100-0b88-11e9-8386-0b600177ad62.png)  。

Supports three different physical-page sizes of
4 Kbytes, 2 Mbytes, and 4 Mbytes. 
Translation tables are aligned on 4-Kbyte boundaries. Physical pages must be aligned on 4-Kbyte, 2-Mbyte, or 4-
Mbyte boundaries, depending on the physical-page size.

#### Translation-Lookaside Buffer (TLB)
When paging is enabled, every memory access has its virtual address automatically translated into a
physical address using the page-translation hierarchy. Translation-lookaside buffers (TLBs), also
known as page-translation caches, nearly eliminate the performance penalty associated with page
translation. TLBs are special on-chip caches that hold the most-recently used virtual-to-physical
address translations. Each memory reference (instruction and data) is checked by the TLB. If the
translation is present in the TLB, it is immediately provided to the processor, thus avoiding external
memory references for accessing page tables.

System software is responsible for managing the TLBs when updates are made to the linear-tophysical
mapping of addresses. A change to any paging data-structure entry is not automatically
reflected in the TLB, and hardware snooping of TLBs during memory-reference cycles is not
performed. Software must invalidate the TLB entry of a modified translation-table entry so that the
change is reflected in subsequent address translations.


#### Global Pages
When page translation is enabled, system-software
performance can often be improved by making some page translations global to all tasks and
procedures. 

When Page-Global Enable (PGE) Bit is enabled, system software can set the global-page (G) bit in the lowest level of the pagetranslation
hierarchy to 1, indicating that the page translation is global. Page translations marked as
global are not invalidated in the TLB when the page-translation-table base address (CR3) is updated.
When the G bit is cleared, the page translation is not global. All supported physical-page sizes also
support the global-page mechanism.

The processor invalidates the TLB whenever CR3 is loaded either explicitly or implicitly. After the
TLB is invalidated, subsequent address references can consume many clock cycles until their
translations are cached as new entries in the TLB. Invalidation of TLB entries for frequently-used or
critical pages can be avoided by specifying the translations for those pages as global. TLB entries for
global pages are not invalidated as a result of a CR3 load. Global pages are invalidated using the
INVLPG instruction. 

The INVLPG instruction ignores the G bit and can be used to invalidate individual global-page entries in the TLB. To invalidate all entries, including global-page entries, disable global-page extensions
(CR4.PGE=0).

#### MTRR和PAT
The MTRR mechanism provides system
software with the ability to manage hardware-device memory mapping. System software can
characterize physical-memory regions by type (e.g., ROM, flash, memory-mapped I/O) and assign
hardware devices to the appropriate physical-memory type.
Another control mechanism is implemented as an extension to the page-translation capability and is
called the page attribute table (PAT). It is described in “Page-Attribute Table Mechanism” on
page 197. Like the MTRRs, PAT provides system software with the ability to manage hardware-device
memory mapping. With PAT, however, system software can characterize physical pages and assign
virtually-mapped devices to those physical pages using the page-translation mechanism. PAT may be
used in conjunction with the MTTR mechanism to maximize flexibility in memory control.
Finally, control mechanisms are provided for managing memory-mapped I/O. These mechanisms
employ extensions to the MTRRs and a separate feature called the top-of-memory registers. The
MTRR extensions include additional MTRR type-field encodings for fixed-range MTRRs and
variable-range I/O range registers (IORRs).
